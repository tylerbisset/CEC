				<p>On November 1st, 1903, All Saint"s Church was started in the University 
				District of Seattle, Washington. Because there was already an Episcopal Church 
				with the name "All Saint"s" in the Seattle area, the name of the church was 
				changed in its early years to Christ Episcopal Church.  A Chapel was built on 
				the corner of NE 47th Street and Brooklyn Avenue NE in 1904, and the first church 
				was built on that site in 1909. In 1914 this structure was moved to the lot south 
				of the corner lot, and it was remodeled to serve as a parish hall. A new church was 
				built on the corner lot. </p>
			</div>

				<img src="images/CEC2.jpg" alt="new location">
				<p>In 1931 the parish hall was moved to 12th NE and given to the YMCA for use as a 
				gymnasium. The church itself was moved to the south lot, and the corner lot was 
				leased to Shell oil for a gas station.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="news3">
				<img src="images/CEC3.jpg" alt="CEC now">
				<p>In 1954 the new church house was dedicated on Nov. 21. This structure, erected on 
				the corner lot, was to be used for offices, Sunday School classes and meeting rooms. 
				Plans had been made to rebuild the church as well, but these were later abandoned, or 
				at least put on indefinite hold, and the church building was bricked.</p>
